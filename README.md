# llm-benchmark-aggregator
Combines benchmark data for LLMs

## Data
The current data being used is from [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/), but this can be extended to any data source as long as the data has columns for score (in which higher values indicate a better score), model labels, and task labels (if there are multiple tasks, ideally)
